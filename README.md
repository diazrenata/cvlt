Cross-validation methods for LDATS

This is a ~package mostly for internal use right now. It builds on github.com/weecology/LDATS to allow model selection via crossvalidation. RMD is in the process of porting functions developed in diazrenata/ldats2020 into a package so they are stable, documented, and testable before trying to scale analyses up.
